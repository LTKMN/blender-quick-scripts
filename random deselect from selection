# this is a script that randomly chooses and deselects (which is sort of the same as selecting from) a currently selected batch - just select your objects or collection and then run it from the text editor

# you can also do this with the Select -> Select Random tool and the ratio slider, but I needed it for a more specific edge case, so, here it is:




import bpy
import random

# Get currently selected objects
selected_objects = bpy.context.selected_objects

# Calculate 25% of the total (you can change this number as needed)
num_to_select = len(selected_objects) // 4

# Shuffle the selected objects
random.shuffle(selected_objects)

# Deselect all objects
bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')

# Select the first 25%
for obj in selected_objects[:num_to_select]:
    obj.select_set(True)
